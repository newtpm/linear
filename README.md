## Synopsis

This report showcases ways that linear regression can be applied to business problems. It acknowledges that linear regression is a simple model, but argues that the simplicity can be its strength in certain situations.



## Motivation

I am frequently asked to improve a business' financial performance and have used linear regression on a number of occassions to get a clear point across to the business line manager or P&L owner. Linear regression is understood intuitively so I am able to keep the point simple and attain buy-in quickly. 


## Installation

The RMarkdown code (Linear Regression for Business.Rmd) and hypothetical dataset (Days Storage.csv) is nearby.
